A Lightning Network ATM, for loose fiat change.

The Fossa is an extension of the Physically Faucet project, by adding support for a coin mechanism.

# Parts (Project cost Â£50)
- ST7735 1.8 TFT, ESP32 NodeMCU 32s, 5v Relay, Multi Coin Acceptor Mechanism, Storage Box, 12v Lead Acid Battery (optional, 12v power supply could be used), DC 12V to 5V/ 3A Voltage Converter with Dual USB

# Workflow
- User puts in chnage (we use Euros, but the mech can be programmed for any fiat, up to 6 different coins)
- Coin mech sends pulses to the ESP32, 1 pulse for every 10cents (could be better, occasionally drops pulses)
- ESP32 calcualtes how much as been entered (capped for demo purposes at 1.50)
- ESP32 connects to lightning.gifts, and generates an invoice for the amount
- ESP32 connects to an LND instance and pays the invoice on lightning.gifts (This project uses a local copy of Zap as an admin macaroon is required so funds should be limited!
- ESP32 fetches the LNURL generated by lightning.gifts 

*note currently LNURL is only supported by "Bitcion Lightning Wallet" and "Bluewallet"
