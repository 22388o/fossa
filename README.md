The Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ATM, dump that stinky loose fiat change for glorious sats!

The Fossa is an extension of the Physically Faucet project, by adding support for a coin mechanism.

# Parts (Project cost Â£50)
- ST7735 1.8 TFT, ESP32 NodeMCU 32s, 5v Relay, Multi Coin Acceptor Mechanism, Storage Box, 12v Lead Acid Battery (optional, 12v power supply could be used), DC 12V to 5V/ 3A Voltage Converter with Dual USB 

# Workflow (LNTXBOT version)
- User puts in chnage (we use Euros, but the mech can be programmed for any fiat, up to 6 different coins)
- Coin mech sends pulses to the ESP32, 1 pulse for every 10cents
- ESP32 calcualtes how much as been entered (capped for demo purposes at 1.50)
- ESP32 connects to your lntxbot, and generates, then returns an LNURL withdraw

# Workflow (lightning.gifts/zap version)
- User puts in chnage (we use Euros, but the mech can be programmed for any fiat, up to 6 different coins)
- Coin mech sends pulses to the ESP32, 1 pulse for every 10cents
- ESP32 calcualtes how much as been entered (capped for demo purposes at 1.50)
- ESP32 connects to lightning.gifts, and generates an invoice for the amount
- ESP32 connects to an LND instance and pays the invoice on lightning.gifts (This project uses a local copy of Zap as an admin macaroon is required so funds should be limited!
- ESP32 fetches the LNURL generated by lightning.gifts
